Game Of Life implemented in Cuda

This is a little project, basically to get my head around Cuda.
Speed-Up of single i7 core (with -O2) to Cuda implementation (on a cheap GTX 550 Ti) is about 30x !!!

Currently there is a Code::Blocks project to compile it. You need to add the nvcc compiler to the list of compilers in Code::Blocks.
